Proposition 1.7. For any x ∈ R there exists n ∈ N s.t. n > x.
Proposition 1.8. Let A ⊂ Z s.t. A ̸= ∅. If A has an upper (resp. lower) bound, then A has
a maximum (resp. minimum).
Proof of Proposition 1.6. By Proposition 1.7, since x2 ̸= x1, let n ∈ N s.t.

Thus, 1/n < x2 − x1. Let us define the following set
A = {a ∈ Z: a > nx1}.
By Proposition 1.7, A ̸= ∅ Further, for any a ∈ A, a > nx1 ⇒ a ≥ nx1. Hence, nx1 is a
lower bound for A. By Proposition 1.8, there exists a minimum m of A. Then, we must
have that
m > nx1 (since m ∈ A) but m − 1 ≤ nx1,
since otherwise we have m − 1 ∈ A which contradicts that m is the smallest number which
is strictly greater than nx1. It follows that

Hence if we let q = m/n, the result follows.

Solution 1.7 (Solution to Exercise 1.7).
(a) We have that x ≤ 1 for any x ∈ A. Thus, 1 is an upper bound for A. Further,
sup A = 1, i.e., 1 is the smallest upper bound of A. This is because 1 ∈ A and hence
s
′ < 1 can not be a smaller upper bound of A. In particular, as 1 ∈ A, the maximum
of A is 1. It is true that x ≥ 0 for any x ∈ A. Thus, 0 is a lower bound for A. Further,
0 is the largest lower bound of A. This is because for any s
′ > 0 there exists n ∈ N
s.t. 1/n < s′
(Proposition 1.7). Thus, it can not be proposition 1.7 the case that there exists a larger
lower bound than 0. This shows that inf A = 0. Notice that 0 ∈/ A, hence A has no
minimum.
(b) First, 0 = inf B and in particular, 0 ∈ B. Hence 0 is the minimum of B. Further, for
any x ∈ B, x ≤ 2. That is, 2 is an upper bound for B. By Proposition 1.6, 2 must be
the smallest upper bound of B. Hence sup B = 2. We note that since 2 ∈/ B, B does
not have a maximum.
