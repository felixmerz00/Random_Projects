The purpose of this project is to identify which definitions, propositions, remarks, examples, and exercises from my STA 110 script are the most relevant and useful to know for the exam. This is achieved by counting the number of references. The result written to the file [reference-frequency.txt](https://github.com/felixmerz00/Random_Projects/blob/master/Reference_Frequency/reference-frequency.txt).
